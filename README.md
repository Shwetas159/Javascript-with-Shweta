A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals

Example
let x = 100 + 50;

variables:

Example
let x = a + b;

Operators and Operands

The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

Adding
The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
